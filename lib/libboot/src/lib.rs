#![no_std]

//! This library is a unified bot library designed to allow a kernel to boot using multiple methods
//! and minimal configuration.
//!
//! This library works by defining a number of entry points which can be used by different boot
//! methods such as multiboot2. These entry points do a minimal amount of work to get the kernel
//! into a unified entry point which does not need to discriminate between boot methods.
//! All entry points are re-exported from the [entry_points] module
//!
//! The binary using this library must provide libboot an entry point named "_libboot_entry" see
//! [kernel_entry] macro for details
// todo add config file to configure libBoot behaviour
