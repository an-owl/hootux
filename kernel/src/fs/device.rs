/// When `Self` returns [FileType::CharDev] any data read from or written to the device may not be

/// Because a device file may need to be accessed from within the kernel it may not be locked.
/// Attempting to call [NormalFile::file_lock] on a device file must return [super::IoError::NotSupported].
